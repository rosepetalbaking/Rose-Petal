      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
       At Sugar Petal Baking, we create handmade desserts inspired mostly by Middle Eastern flavors and traditions, blended with a modern, delicate touch. Every treat is baked in small batches using quality ingredients, traditional techniques, and plenty of care—never mass-produced.

We proudly offer local delivery only, allowing us to focus on freshness and detail from our kitchen to your door. From fragrant pastries infused with rose and pistachio to comforting classic desserts, each item is carefully crafted by hand and made to order.

Sugar Petal Baking is about celebrating culture, sweetness, and special moments—whether for a gathering, a celebration, or a simple indulgence. When you order from us, you’re supporting local, handmade baking rooted in tradition and made with heart.
